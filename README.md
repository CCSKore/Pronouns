# Pronouns
PronounDB in Minecraft!
Just a silly little API for PronounDB

Supports Paper (and Purpur), Sponge and Fabric!

## FAQ
Folia support?
Sorry not yet, when the platform is more stable and is released to the public, only then will I support Folia.

Forge support?
No, I'd rather eat a shoe. Feel free to make a mod to use the API to add Forge support, I'm not interested in Forge.

NeoForge support?
I haven't tried NeoForge out development wise and it's early in development, once it's more stable I will experiment and see if I wanna add it.

Quilt support?
Likely works with the Fabric mod already but I'm not gonna test, someone feel free to DM me on Discord (novampr) and tell me if it works though.

API extensions?
Soonâ„¢

Why not support Bukkit/Spigot?
While I can, they are old. Let's face it, Paper is faster and you probably don't have reason to use it. However feel free to fork the project to add support for this.

Velocity support?
Planned, just not now, I haven't had the time yet.

Bungeecord/Waterfall support?
Probably not, not worth the hassle for the few people that may benefit from this. Again, feel free to fork and add, maybe make a PR and I'll consider adding it lol.
